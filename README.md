# ProgramUpdater
A framework to automatize the process of updating a program.

## Components
The process to create a new update, once that you have a new release to distribute, is composed of the steps:

- Create the metadata of the new release
- Distribute the metadata and the new artifacts
- Run the update program

All these steps are covered by this framework.
